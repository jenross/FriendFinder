# Friend Finder

## About

Friend Finder is a full-stack application that matches users to a character from NBC's "The Good Place" based on survey results. Node.js & an Express server on the back-end handle routing and connect to the "friends" API, which stores the character data. HTML & CSS(with a Bootstrap framework) display the landing page, survey, and user's match (via a modal pop-up) on the front-end. The application is deployed to Heroku.
